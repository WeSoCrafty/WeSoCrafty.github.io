How to edit
-----------

Create posts in `_posts`. They're displayed in alphabetical order, so be sure to put yours in line with the others. The main config file is `_config.yml`. 

You can test your changes by running:

    jekyll serve -w
    
in the root directory. A preview of the site will be available at http://localhost:4000

How to deploy
-------------

When you're ready to deploy, push your changes to the `gh-pages` branch on github, which will trigger a Jekyll build and deploy the site.

    git push origin gh-pages
